# WP0
Starter empty Wordpress install (with _s theme)

## Credentials
- WP user: admin
- WP password: admin

## Usage
1. Copy database in /db/latest.sql*
2. Change database access and site URL in /wp-config.php
3. To edit _s, follow the theme's readme

### Current ERROR
*I forgot to save the DB :/ so I guess: delete /wp-config.php and just let wordpress create the DB again, set up and save it ...

## Also
I should add some cool plugins that I often use so I don't just forget them
